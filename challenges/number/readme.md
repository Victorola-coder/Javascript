# Number Challenge

**Instructions:**

Create a variable called `x` that is a random number between 1 and 100 along with a variable called `y` that is a random number between 1 and 50.

Create a variable for the sum, difference, product, quotient and remainder of `x` and `y`. Log the output in a string that shows the two numbers of `x` and `y` along with the operator and result.
