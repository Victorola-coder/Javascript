## challenge 1

Use some of the array methods that we looked at to mutate the following array to = the expected result below:

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

**Expected Result:**

```js
console.log(arr);
// [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0];
```

### Challenge 2:

**Instructions:**

Combine `arr1` and `arr2` into a new array called `arr3` with the following elements:

```js
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
```

Notice that both `arr1` and `arr2` include the number 5. You will have to find a way to get rid of the extra 5.

**Expected Result:**

```js
console.log(arr3);
// [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```
