# Object Challenge

### Step 1

Create an array of objects called `library`. Add 3 objects with a property of `title`, `author`, `status`. Title and author should be strings (whatever value you want) and status should be another object with the properties of `own`, `reading` and `read`. Which should all be boolean values. For all status, set `own` to `true` and `reading` and `read` to false.

### Step 2

You finished reading all of the books. Set the `read` value for all of them to `true`. Do not edit the initial object. Set the values using dot notation.

### Step 3

Destructure the title from the first book and rename the variable to `firstBook`

### Step 4

Turn the library object into a JSON string.
