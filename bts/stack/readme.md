in computer science, a `stack` is a data structure, we'll get deeper into stacks. It's a **LIFO (last in, first out)** data structure. What this means is the last thing to be put on top of the stack is the first to come off.

Well every function that was invoked was added to something we call the `call stack`. It's also referred to as the `execution stack` and many other terms. This keeps track of the functions that are currently being executed. You think of it as an execution context manager.
